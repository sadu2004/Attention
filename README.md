This project will involve two parts:

First, we use the transformers Python library, developed by AI software company Hugging Face, to write a program that uses BERT to predict masked words. The program will also generate diagrams visualizing attention scores, with one diagram generated for each of the 144 attention heads.

Second, we analyze the diagrams generated by our program to try to understand what BERT’s attention heads might be paying attention to as it attempts to understand our natural language.
This project was part of the CS50AI course offered by Edx and Harvard University.
